# A webpage using CSS, and HTML with the BEM methodology

I built this webpage using different technologies, such as flexbox, in order to maitain sections which contain tables. I also used animations in order add movement to geometric shapes. I used iframes when I inserted youtube videos. The CSS classes and files were organized according to BEM methodology. 

# Future steps

* Adding different fonts in order to make the web page a more personal touch.
* Adding more explanatory videos.
* design a form to allow users to send a comment.
* Add some more animations and CSS transforms in order to be able to use "hovering" over certain features such as links and buttons.
